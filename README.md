# Useless's Shop Bot

This bot is based around SellAuth, And Uses a Key System i made that makes the user join your discord server to redeem the product. This bot uses Supabase to manage and view the data and items you sell. Upon Key Redemption it will give the user a Buyer Role and log every action preformed during the redemption module.

How to set up: Download the ZIP file provided and load it into a code editor like Visual Studio Code, Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- supabase
- dotenv
- discord
- requests

Once installed, Make a file and name it: .env and past the following code into it:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
STATUS=Redeeming Keys 🗝️

SUPABASE_URL=SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_KEY=SUPABASE_ANNON_KEY

SELLAUTH_API_KEY=
SELLAUTH_SHOP_ID=
```


To Get you SellAuth Info, go to your Sellauth Dash and retrieve your info from the Personal Section

Then, Config both that and shop.py, along with role_redeem.py, invoice_redeem.py, and code_redeem.py

Making a Supabase database:
Go to supabase.com and create an account, then make a new project and create your first database, scroll down to find your URL and ANNON KEY. then, go to your navagation and click "SQL Editor" paste in the following code:

```
-- Table: products
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.products (
    id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    key text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    product text NOT NULL,
    context text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
    redeemed boolean DEFAULT false
);

-- Optional: Add an index for faster key lookups
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_key ON public.products (key);

-- Optional: Make sure only unique, unredeemed keys can exist
ALTER TABLE public.products
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_active_key UNIQUE (key, redeemed);
```

Then Make a New SQL code tab and paste the following code

```
CREATE TABLE public.role_redeem (
    id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    code text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    role_id bigint NOT NULL,
    redeemed boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    redeemed_by bigint
);
```

Then click Run Selected towards the bottom right to middle corner. it should respond with "Success. No rows returned" That means you did this correct. Now all you have to do is upload your product info in the **product* row and the redeem key in *key* row,  for each product you want to make, create a new row, this will represent your stock, each time a key is redeemed, the row and all its data is deleted.


**How to use the json system**

With our new update, youu can send digital zip files to your customers! To do this, open buttonconfig.json

It Might Look Like this:

```
{
  "buttons": [
    {
      "ButtonName": "Claim Fortnite Pack",
      "ButtonColor": "green",
      "ButtonProductPath": "./products/fortnite_pack.zip",
      "RedeemRole": "1438358929187934310"
    },
    {
      "ButtonName": "Claim Minecraft Mod",
      "ButtonColor": "blurple",
      "ButtonProductPath": "./products/mc_mod.zip",
      "RedeemRole": "143900000000000000"
    }
  ]
}
```
Or this:
```
{
  "buttons": [
    {
      "ButtonName": "Claim Fortnite Pack",
      "ButtonColor": "green",
      "ButtonProductPath": "./Products/Vouch-Bot.zip",
      "RedeemRole": "1439009409522077898"
    }
  ]
}
```

If it does Amazing! This is how to config it! For what i know you can have as many virtual product buttons as you want, each button template consists of this:
```
{
      "ButtonName": "",
      "ButtonColor": "",
      "ButtonProductPath": "",
      "RedeemRole": ""
}
```
For every product, add a new collum of that code!

Now, the button Name is Pretty Obvious, the name of the buttons. But for the button color, your quite limited because of discord. Here are your options
```
Options:
- grey
- green
- gray
- red
- blurple
```
For the "ButtonProductPath" Its the Past to your product you be sending to the user, for example:
```
./Products/Vouch-Bot.zip
```
Then for the RedeemRole, Its the role you need to claim the zip file and click the button. This will be auto-added when they redeem the code you sent them via sellauth, using the code-redeem command.

And boom! Thats how you use the config for the New Panel!
